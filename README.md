# CardMatchingGame

## Overview

This project is a card matching game using javascript as the main development language. The game will be fun and easy to play and responsive so it can be played on all devices by anyone.

The aim of this project is to showcase understanding of many aspects of javascript and at the same time make a fun and interactive game. 

I also wish to make the development process clean and easy to follow to allow anyone to take a look at the project and understand the process and the different stages that the project took.
